\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct__matrix}{\-\_\-matrix} \\*Matrix between matrix and vector they are able to be casted into one another }{\pageref{struct__matrix}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct__vector}{\-\_\-vector} \\*Vector padding is to make sure that matrix and vector both have the same byte size and allignment between matrix and vector they are able to be casted into one another }{\pageref{struct__vector}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
