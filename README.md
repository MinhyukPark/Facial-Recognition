# Facial-Recognition

Facial Detection using Eigenfaces

## Motivation

Trying to apply what I learned in class about Principal Component Analysis and 
Singular Value Decomposition and create a C-library for a set of functions that
will determine whether a given image contains a humanly-recognizable face or not,
and if recognized if it is a face that is in the dataset.

## TODOs

### Design Decisions

how to represent an image?
double**?

Catastrophic cancellation when normalizing?

### Linear Algebra functions

matmat_subtract()
matmat_multiply()
vecmat_multiply()
matvec_multiply()
matscalar_multiply()
mat_transpose()

### Libtiff
